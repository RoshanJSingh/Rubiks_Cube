Rubik's Cube Solver
This project is a Rubik's Cube solver implemented in C++. It provides multiple representations of the Rubik's Cube (3D array, 1D array, and bitboard) and uses various solving algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS), and IDA*.

Features
Cube Representations:
RubiksCube3dArray: A 3D array representation of the cube.
RubiksCube1dArray: A 1D array representation of the cube.
RubiksCubeBitboard: A bitboard representation for efficient operations.
Solving Algorithms:
DFS Solver: Depth-First Search with a maximum depth limit.
BFS Solver: Breadth-First Search for finding the shortest solution.
IDDFS Solver: Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search.
IDA Solver*: A heuristic-based solver using pattern databases.
Pattern Databases:
Corner Pattern Database for heuristic calculations.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
C++ Compiler:
GCC (MinGW for Windows) or Clang.
CMake:
Install CMake from https://cmake.org/download/.
OpenMP:
Ensure your compiler supports OpenMP for parallel processing.

## How to Build and Run

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoshanJSingh/Rubiks-Cube.git
cd Rubiks-Cube


2. Build the Project
Using CMake
Create a build directory:
mkdir build
cd build
Run CMake to configure the project:
cmake ..
Build the project:
cmake --build .
Using g++
Alternatively, you can compile the project directly using g++:
g++ main.cpp RubiksCube3dArray.cpp RubiksCube1dArray.cpp RubiksCubeBitboard.cpp CornerPatternDatabase.cpp CornerDBMaker.cpp -o rubiks_cube_solver -fopenmp
3. Run the Executable
After building, run the executable:
./rubiks_cube_solver

Usage
Example Code
The main.cpp file contains example usage of the solvers. You can uncomment sections to test different solvers or representations.
Example Output
The program will:
Randomly shuffle the cube.
Solve the cube using the selected algorithm.
Print the solution moves and the solved cube.
